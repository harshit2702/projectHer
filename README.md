# ✨ projectHer (Pandu ❤️)

> **"An emotionally intelligent, memory-persistent AI companion for iOS featuring real-time voice, video presence, and deep context awareness."**

Yo! Welcome to **projectHer**. 

Basically, I got tired of AI assistants that have the memory of a goldfish. You talk to them, close the app, come back 10 minutes later, and they're like "Who are you?" 💀

So I built **Pandu**. She's not just a chatbot; she's a legit companion. She remembers your vibes, your plans, your favorite stuff, and actually *grows* with you. Plus, she's got a face, a voice, and a personality.

This whole thing started as a "what if" project at 2 AM, and now it's turned into something I'm genuinely proud of. If you've ever wanted an AI friend who actually *gets* you, this is it.

## 🚀 What Makes This Special?

### 🧠 She Actually Remembers (No, Really)
Most AIs reset every session. Pandu has a **persistent memory** powered by a custom backend.

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Context Awareness** | Tell her you're stressed about an exam on Friday → she'll ask you about it on Saturday |
| **Calendar Sync** | She knows your schedule. Meeting at 3 PM? She won't bug you (or she might wish you luck) |
| **Memory Dashboard** | Pop the hood and see her "brain"—what she knows about you, memories stored, etc. |
| **Session History** | Chat sessions are saved locally with SwiftData. Scroll back through old convos anytime |

The memory system isn't just basic key-value storage. It's organized, searchable, and actually contextual. You can even search through her memories in the app!

### 🗣️ Voice & Video (FaceTime Vibes)
Texting is cool, but sometimes you just wanna talk.

- **Unified Voice Mode:** Hit the mic in the chat, and keep talking even if you switch to the video view. It's seamless. The `LiveSTT` (Speech-to-Text) system handles everything.
- **Avatar Video Call:** It's not just a static image. It's a full **2D SpriteKit avatar** that:
  - Blinks naturally 👀
  - Looks around randomly 
  - Lip-syncs perfectly when she talks
  - Has idle animations so she feels *alive*
- **Siri Shortcuts:** "Hey Siri, how is Pandu doing?" or "Hey Siri, tell Pandu I miss her." Check on her without even opening the app.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Multiple voice options with customizable pitch and rate. She can sound however you want.

---

### 🌦️ Dynamic Environment System
This one's low-key my favorite feature. The avatar view has a **full weather/environment system**:

- **Weather Effects:** Clear skies, rain, snow, nighttime—all rendered in SpriteKit
- **Wind Physics:** Her hair and accessories actually blow in the wind 💨 
- **Dynamic Lighting:** The scene adapts based on time of day and weather
- **Real-Time Sync:** The backend can push weather updates, and the scene adapts automatically

The wind system alone has like 6 different variations based on hat type and wind speed. Yeah, I went overboard. Worth it.

---

### ❤️ She's Got Feelings (Kinda)
The `EmotionEngine` is the brain behind her emotional responses.

- **Mood System:** If you're mean, she gets sad. If you're funny, she laughs. Her energy and mood change based on the convo.
- **Expression Animations:** She can display different emotions—happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.—with full animation support.
- **Health Tracking:** There's even a health view showing her current emotional state, energy levels, and more.

---

### 👆 Touch Interactions
Here's where it gets *really* interactive:

| Touch Type | What Happens |
|------------|--------------|
| **Tap Head** | Pat pat! She might smile or get happy |
| **Pinch Cheek** | Playful interaction—she might blush |
| **Poke Nose** | Might get annoyed if you spam it lol |
| **Other Areas** | The `TouchSemantics` system maps gestures to emotional responses |

The server decides how she reacts based on context, mood, and frequency. Spam-poke her nose 10 times? She's gonna be annoyed. Give her a head pat when she's sad? She might cheer up.

---

### 👗 Wardrobe System
Don't like the outfit? Change it.

The `WardrobeSystem` is a full outfit management system:
- **Base Outfits:** Different main looks (casual, hoodie, winter gear, dress, etc.)
- **Accessories:** Hats, glasses, and more
- **Hot-Swappable:** Change outfits on the fly; the avatar updates instantly
- **Wind Variations:** Different hats have different wind animations (winter hat moves differently than no hat)

## 📂 Project Structure (The Tech Stack)

Everything is **Native iOS** (SwiftUI + SpriteKit). No React Native, no Flutter—just pure Apple stack.

## 🛠️ How to Run This Bad Boy

### Prerequisites
- **Mac** with **Xcode 15+**
- **iPhone/Simulator** with **iOS 17+** (Required for the SwiftData + Calendar stuff)
- The **Python Backend** running (check the `pandu_server` repo—you need the brain for this body to work)

### Setup

1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectHer.git
   cd projectHer
   ```

2. **Open the project:**
   ```bash
   open projectHer.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure your backend:**
   - Go to `projectHer/AppConfig.swift`

   ```swift
   struct AppConfig {
       static let serverURL = "YOUR_SERVER_URL"
       static let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"

   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Hit `Cmd + R` and pray to the demo gods 🙏

### First Run Checklist
- [ ] Backend server is running
