## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within **projectHer**, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT create a public issue.** Publicly disclosing a vulnerability can put all users at risk.
2.  Send an email to [harshitagarwal46446@icloud.com].
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant code snippets or screenshots.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and work with you to understand the issue and provide a fix.

## Security Best Practices for Users

*   **API Keys:** Never share your `API_KEY` or commit it to public repositories.
*   **Server URL:** Ensure your backend server is secured (HTTPS) if deployed publicly.
*   **Data Privacy:** This app processes personal conversations. Ensure you trust the hosting environment of the Python backend.
